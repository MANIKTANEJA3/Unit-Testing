Project Explanation:
1.	The project is a simple representation of how unit testing is put to work in python. The task of the project is to unit test a block of code that has different items listed in a class. The class is defined as a ‘shirt class’; the class has the following member functions 
•	__init()__
•	Change_price
•	Discount
2.	Different inputs are provided to the member functions using the variable defined in the __init()__ class. The inputs are given wrongly so that the unit testing done afterwards can identify the faults in the program logic and correctly prompt the coder to take the necessary actions.
3.	A new block of code that goes by the name of run_test is written to test the logic of the code and the input values in the previous statements. The assert keyword is used so that the coder knows what logic is to be maintained in the program and the inputs should comply with the structure of the flow of logic.


The purpose of this project was to understand the basics of python as a high-level language, its features and applications.
In computer programming, Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—which are defined as sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they comply with the constraints, parameter definitions and are fit for use.
 
Tasks involved in Unit Testing are as follows:
Unit Test Plan
•	Prepare
•	Review
•	Rework
•	Baseline


Unit Test Cases/Scripts
•	Prepare
•	Review
•	Rework
•	Baseline
Unit Test
•	Perform
